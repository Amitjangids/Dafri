                <h3>What is DeFi?</h3>
                <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) enables anyone to lend, borrow, earn interest or take out insurance without a bank clerk rummaging through your income and expenses statements and demanding box-loads of documents. It uses a P2P network to establish decentralized applications that would enable everyone to connect and manage their assets regardless of their status and location. It provides an open-source, transparent, and secure financial service environment. </p>

                <h3>How do DafriDigital Bank DeFi loans work?</h3>
                <p>The DeFi Loans has major three parts :</p>
                <p>1) <strong>Lending:</strong> Customer lends its cryptocurrency and earns interest and rewards every minute. The cryptocurrency is lent by the lender through smart contracts on which he earns interest.</p>
                <p>2) <strong> Borrowing: </strong> Borrower who is in need of funds, deposits the collateral (no physical property is involved) which is more valuable than the loan amount, to get a loan.</p>
                <p>3) <strong>Smart contracts:</strong> While the platform is decentralized so it prevents manipulation of processes and ensures that the lender’s assets are protected all the time and he receives the interest on time DeFi protocol ensures that the borrower should deposit collateral (in cryptocurrencies) using a smart contract. Only after the borrower pays back the loan, the smart contract distributes a part of the collateral to the lenders as interest payment and sends the remaining collateral back to the borrower.</p>
