                    <p>This AML/KYC Policy encompasses all reasonable and appropriate procedures related to money laundering prevention, financing of terrorism and other illegal activities.</p>


                    <p>For purposes of this AML/KYC Policy, “us,” “we,” “our,” “ <strong>DAFRIGROUP PUBLIC LIMITED</strong> ” Sometimes referred to as <strong>DAFRIBANK PLC</strong>, or "dafribank.com ”refer to the website https://dafribank.com/ and related services.</p>

                    <p>Our Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer Policy (hereinafter referred to
                        as “AML/KYC Policy”) is designated to prevent and mitigate possible risks of us being
                        involved in any kind of illegal activity.</p>

                    <p>DafriGroup provides secure payment solution, digital banking / fin-tech services,

                        suspected of or directly involved in money laundering in order to conceal the source
                        of illicit funds and make funds appear legitimate. Both international and local
                        regulations require us to implement effective internal procedures and mechanisms to

                    <h4>Risk-Based Approach:</h4>


                    <p>DafriGroup adopts and maintains a Risk-Based Approach (“RBA”) in order to assess
                        and prevent any money-laundering and terrorist financing risks. Successful
                        implementation of the RBA will allow resources to be allocated in the most efficient
                        ways. Prior to entering into any transaction or proposed transaction, mandatory
                        checks shall be conducted in accordance with the RBA to ensure that the customer’s
                        identity does not coincide with any person with known criminal background or with
                        banned entities such as terrorist organizations. The main principle is that resources
                        should be directed in accordance with priorities so that the greatest risks receive the
                        highest attention.</p>

                    <h4>User Verification:</h4>
                    <p>One of the international standards for detecting and preventing illegal activity is
                        customer due diligence (“CDD”). In accordance with CDD, DafriGroup has established
                        mandatory verification procedures within the standards of AML/KYC frameworks.</p>
                    <p>As a condition of verification and your use of the DafriGroup services, DafriGroup
                        reserves the right to require you to provide us with such information, documentation,

                        particular user). In addition, DafriGroup reserves the right to request up-to-date
                        scanned copies of documents from any registered user, even if the user completed

                        please hide the CVV code (you can use a piece of paper, for example) and a part of

                    <p>“Selfie” verification — it is validation of a one-time selfie photo of a user to ensure the
                        legitimacy and enhanced security of user sensitive data. There are 2 (two) types of

                        should be readable, there should not be any modifications or edits of the document
                        scans/photos, otherwise we would have to reject them and request new copies

                    <p>Proof of income — it is an official document or set of documents necessary for

                        DafriGroup needs to execute on the behalf of the user. This verification measure is
                        required for the purpose of enhanced due diligence and a transaction execution of
                        particularly large sums of money. User is required to provide scanned copies of an
                        official bank statement (personal or business) or pay stubs or tax returns.</p>
                    <p>Once the spending limit for your verification tier has been reached, it is mandatory to

                        spending limit system.</p>
                    <p>We reserve the right to reject any person on registering on https://dafribank.com/
                        and using related services if we are unable to verify any information due to
                        non-cooperation of the customer, or if customer's actions are likely to have a material
                        adverse effect on us for being in violation of any applicable laws or industry
                        best-practice guidelines. We will also reject and terminate any relationship with any
                        person who is a subject of sanctions (financial and others) of any country of the world
                        as well as any international respected organization.</p>
                    <p>We may from time to time temporarily reject customers from some
                        countries/territories according to FATF “High-Risk and Other Monitored Jurisdictions”
                        recommendations and our RBA. This applies to both new customers at the
                        registration stage and existing users of our services. In the latter case, we will notify
                        the customer of the refusal to provide services in advance, and provide reasonable
                        time for the termination of the use of our services.</p>


                    <h4>Monitoring Transactions:</h4>


                    <p>DafriGroup diligently monitors transactions for suspicious activity. Therefore, we rely
                        on data analysis as a risk-assessment and suspicion detection tool. We perform a
                        variety of compliance-related tasks, including capturing data, filtering, record
                        keeping, investigation management and reporting. System functionalities include:</p>
                    <p>a) A daily check of customers against recognized “black lists” (e.g. OFAC),
                        aggregating transfers by multiple data points, placing customers on watch and
                        service denial lists, opening cases for investigation if it is essential, sending internal
                        communications and filling out statutory reports, if applicable;</p>
                    <p>b) Case and document management with regard to AML/KYC Policy, we will analyze
                        all provided customers' data and monitor all transactions and it reserves the right to:
                        ensure that transactions of suspicious nature are reported to the proper law
                        enforcement authority through the Compliance Officer; request the customer to
                        provide any additional information and documents in case of suspicious transactions;
                        temporary suspend (block) or terminate customer's account when we have
                        reasonable suspicion that such customer is engaged in illegal activity.</p>
                    <p>The above list is not exhaustive and the Compliance Officer will monitor users’
                        transactions on a day-to-day basis to establish whether such transactions are to be
                        reported and treated as suspicious or are to be treated as bona fide. We reserve the
                        right to refuse to process a transaction at any stage. Especially, when we believe that
                        a transaction is connected in any way to money laundering or any other type of
                        criminal activity.</p>
                    <p>AML/KYC Policy is revisited periodically and amended from time to time based on
                        prevailing industry standards and international regulations designed to facilitate the
                        prevention of illicit activity, inclusive of money laundering and terrorist financing. We
                        recommend that you regularly check for changes and that you review our AML/KYC
                        Policy when visiting our website. If you do not agree with any aspect of the updated
