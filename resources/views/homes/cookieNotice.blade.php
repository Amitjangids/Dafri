            <p>There are different types of cookies which are used for different purposes. In this section, we describe five different functions but be aware that not all these types will be used on every website you visit, and some cookies may fit into multiple categories.  'Strictly necessary' cookies. These cookies are necessary for the website to function correctly and cannot be switched off in our systems. </p>
            <p>They are usually only set in response to actions made by you, which amount to a request for services. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. They are activated when you visit our website and remain active for the duration of your visit.</p>
            <p>'Strictly necessary' cookies store data which can be used to remember your privacy preferences; allow you to log in or fill in forms; move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website; meet our legal and regulatory requirements, for example, anti-money laundering and fraud prevention; secure your account and prevent it being misused by others.</p>
            <h3>'Performance' cookies </h3>
            <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site to give you a better service.</p>
            <p>They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and, therefore, anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not be able to use your experience of the site to monitor and improve its performance.</p>
            <p>Performance cookies can be used to record where visitors click on each page and track which services they look for; log error messages from web pages; help improve the websites to make information and services quicker and easier to access on both desktop and mobile browsers. </p>
            <h3>'Functional' cookies </h3>
            <p>These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features.</p>
            <p>For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised, and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. So, basically, these cookies remember choices you make to improve your user experience. </p>

            <p>They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission.

Quite often, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation. So, basically, these cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.
