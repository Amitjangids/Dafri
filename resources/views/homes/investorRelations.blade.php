            <h2>Why Africa Needs Dafribank</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-12">

                <p>Current payment solutions are not tailored to meet the needs of
                    the average African digital entrepreneurs who have continued to
                    service providers. This is just one of the reasons why Africa needs a
                    Digital payment solution by Africans and for Africans. There are
                    other reasons.</p>
                <p>Traditional banks are still struggling to reach the unbanked across
                    Africa. In 2014, a staggering 66% of Sub-Saharan Africans did not
                    financial literacy, low-income levels, political instability, and weak
                    judicial systems have created a constrained African banking
                    system. And banks continue to rely on traditional banking models
                    of branch networks, expensive technology, inadequate systems,
                    and a limited talent pool. As per the latest reports issued by the
                    World Bank (Global Findex Database) in August 2017, around
                    2 billion people were unbanked across the world.</p>
                <p>DafriBank's unique solution of combining conventional banking
                    in Africa with emerging Cryptocurrency/blockchain technology
                    can bridge the gap and play a vital role in the financial inclusion of
                    people who are still unbanked. Also, the global adoption rate of
                    cryptocurrency is still below 3%. More education and adoption still
                    needs to happen. DafriBank is committed to doing so by having structures in different countries to help embrace its unique digital
                    banking solutions. The current population of Africa as a whole
                    stands at 1.3 Billion (According to the United Nation's estimate)
                    which has a growth rate of 2.5% yearly. This huge market serves as
                    the target market for DafriBank</p>
                <p>The traditionally unbanked of Africa are devoid of a strong
                    financial footprint but the optimism shown towards
                    cryptocurrency by these people promises a better future
                    financially.</p>
                <p>The cryptocurrency industry's stratospheric market capitalization in such a short time shows the overall growth potential that the
                    cryptocurrency market has, but also the role emerging African
                    markets would play in contributing to this growth.</p>
                <p>DafriBank's journey will begin in South Africa and Nigeria and
                    gradually spread to other parts of Africa and then globally.
                    Achieving such levels of mass adoption, we aim to provide access
                    to financial services to a large section of Africa's population thus
                    promoting the overall economic growth of the continent which
                    would thus lead to a better quality of life.</p>
